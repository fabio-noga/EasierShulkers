## Some Questions

> *What happens if I right click a placed shulker with a shulker in hand?*

In that case the priority will be on the placed shulker, so this will be opened instead of the shulker in the hand.

> *Can I use inventory shortcuts like shift click to move stacks and such?*

Yes, any inventory shurtcut that you use in a normal shulker can be used in this.

> *Will my shulker's names appear in the menu?*

Yes, shulker's names are one of the best underappreciated features on shulkers.

> *Can I Right click on the ground without placing it?*

Of course, only Shift Right Click places the block
